This project implements a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system using Flask, Keras, and MobileNetV2. Users can upload images as search queries, and the system will retrieve and display the most visually similar images from a dataset. The program uses MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and scikit-learn's NearestNeighbours algorithm with cosine similarity to find the closest matching images. The dataset consists of categorized image folders (e.g., 'vehicle,' 'cat,' 'dog,' etc.), and the retrieval process is optimized using a Flask web interface.
